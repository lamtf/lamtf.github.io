Refactoring could be a problem specially if you need to deal with many different places on your code. For the purpose of refactoring we have a solution which maybe will not solve all the problems related to refactoring. The first thing to notice is that we are presenting transformations which reach to the code layer by layer, so maybe you don’t need to go deeper before testing your ideas. Maybe you really just want to make a prototype of your software. The current framework will help you generating disposable code. Mostly because you can just adding the changes to your code, and make your contributions in the higher layers, where you are supposed to make your custom design and also adding whatever you want and cannot generate by using this framework.
